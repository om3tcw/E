Poruka oruka? Oruyo!

Repository for the /hlgg/ cytube

  Please avoid making too much of a mess if you change anything

EMOTES
  Please keep emote names the same as they are on cytube
  If you rename an emote on the cytube, please rename the file here on the github as well
  for the filenames, emotes with "?" and "/" in the name have those characters changed, ? becomes - and / becomes _ 
  
  TO UPLOAD EMOTES:
    1. Click on the "emotes" folder
    2. Click "Add file" and on the dropdown click "Upload files"
    3. Add your emotes
    4. click "Commit changes"

CSS/JS
  If you make changes to any of the css or js files that are pushed through jsdelivr, they seem to take around a day to actually update, so consider uploading a new temporary file   if you want the changes to be immediate


Stay hydrated, hoocha!
